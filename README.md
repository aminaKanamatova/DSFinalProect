Data Structures Final Project Report 
Amina Kanamatova 

In this project I have three main classes. The Kdnn class reads input data, constructs the k-d tree and outputs the nearest neighbors for given word vectors.The Word class represents a word and its high-dimensional vector.The KDTree class implements the k-d tree  and provides methods for building the tree and performing nearest neighbor search.
I wasnâ€™t able to make the code work entirely for part 2, at first it was kind of working but then I started getting the NullPointerException which I am still trying to figure out.
